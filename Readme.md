## Repo description
Each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python. There is also a custom made Machine learning package importable with `pip install` that details the implimentation of a Perceptron and a logistic regression model.

The following have been implemented as covered in class:

- Supervised learning
    - Perceptron
    - Linear Regression
    - Gradient Descent
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Deep Neural Networks 
        - with TensorFlow
    - k-Nearest Neigbors
- Unsupervised Learning
    - Label Propagation
- Machine Learning package
    - Perceptron
    - Logistic regression w/ SGD
    - Testing with Pytest
    - Sample usage with real DataSet
