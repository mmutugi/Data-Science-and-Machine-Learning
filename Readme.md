This is a repo with codes covering concepts from introductory phases up to advanced use cases of Python In Machine Learning and Data Analytics, including back propagation and regression. Authored By Mark Munyi

## Repo description
Each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python. There is also a custom made Machine learning package importable with `pip install` that details the implimentation of a Perceptron and a logistic regression model.
